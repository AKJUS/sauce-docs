Audio Streaming is a functionality that gives you the ability to stream the audio stream generated by your native mobile app (Android or iOS/iPadOS) during a live test.

## What You'll Need

- A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up))
- A native Android, iOS, or iPadOS mobile app.

## Using Audio Streaming on Real Devices

To enable Audio Streaming during Live Testing you need allow the following protocols:
- Peer-to-peer connection
- Allow Twilio domains within your firewalls. (You can test it on the following [link]([url](https://networktest.twilio.com/)))
- Audio and Performance mode enabled in the Live Testing toolbar under Device Settings.

You just need to launch a Live Testing session on a real device, and the audio will be streamed automatically without any configuration.

The Audio Streaming feature ensures a better digital experience by validating audio playback and testing user flows that require audio testing in the early stages of the development lifecycle.

With the Audio Streaming feature, you can hear the sound your application is making during a Live Testing session. It allows you to validate audio streams, notification sounds, and animations.
You will be able to test Android Talkback functionality during a session by enabling it under the Accessibility options in the toolbar. 

:::note
You will be able to mute and unmute the sound during your session by clicking on the mute/unmute button on the toolbar:
