Execute tests up to 70% faster using Hosted Orchestration. Hosted Orchestration runs mobile and broswer tests for you from within the Sauce Labs grid. It works using our container execution environment. All you need to do is package your test code as a Docker image and grant us access. 

Hosted Orchestration is different from traditional remote grid execution because it removes a large portion of the network traffic which drastically increases the amount of time to execute a test suite from your environment.
