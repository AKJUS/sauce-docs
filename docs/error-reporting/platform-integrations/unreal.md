Backtrace's integration with Unreal allows you to capture and report native crashes 

## Features

The Backtrace Unreal plugin reports on the following types of errors:

* Crashes - An end to the game play experience, where the game crashes or restarts.
* Hangs (mobile only) -  Errors that occur when a game or an app is non-responsive.
* Out of memory crashes (mobile only) - Terminations of your game or app due to low memory conditions.
