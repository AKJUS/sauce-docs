# Audio Capture 

Audio Capture is a functionality that gives you the ability to record the audio stream generated by your native mobile app (Android or iOS/iPadOS) during a live or automated real device test. 

With this feature, the audio is recorded on our side and merged with the video recording, which you can access in your **Test Results**.

## What You'll Need

* A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up))
* A native Android, iOS, or iPadOS mobile app that makes HTTP/HTTPS requests. We currently support the following:
  * Android 10 and higher
  * iOS 10+ up to iOS 15.3


## Using Audio Capture on Real Devices

To enable audio capture in your tests: 
 
1. On Sauce Labs, click **Live** > **Mobile App**.
2. [Upload your mobile app to Sauce Labs](/mobile-apps/app-storage) through the UI or CLI.
3. After youâ€™ve uploaded your app, return to the **Live** > **Mobile App** page, hover your mouse over your app, then select **Settings**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/networkcapturescr.png')} alt="Mobile app settings navigation" width="800"/>

5. **For Automated Testing only:** add the `audioCapture` capability to your test script. Click the link below corresponding to your framework:
   * Espresso (coming soon)
   * XCUITest (coming soon)
   * [Appium](/dev/test-configuration-options/#audiocapture)
  
  
Now you can start your live or automated testing session.Your audio recording will be captured and be part of the video recording in the test results page.

## Accessing the Audio in Your Test Tesults

The audio recording will be included into the video recording, which you will can play back and download from the built-in media player on the **Test Results** page. 

You can also download the video file with the included audio stream programmatically using the following API request: 

```
curl --compressed \ -O https://{SAUCE_USERNAME}:{SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY}@{DATA_CENTER}.saucelabs.com/v1/rdc/jobs/{JOB_ID}/video.mp4
```

### Streaming the Audio (coming soon)
