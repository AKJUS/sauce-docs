<!-- A part of a good testing strategy is to create end-to-end tests that resemble common user flows. Consider a scenario where a company has an authentication server. This server, when given the proper user credentials, returns an authentication token. This token is required for all other calls throughout the company's API environment. Without this first API call, none of the other API calls can work. -->
