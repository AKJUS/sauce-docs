TestFairy requires that you call `begin` in order to start recording your sessions. However, developers have the option to override the build settings to determine what is enabled during a session recording.

Some commonly used options:

- [Crash Reporting](#crash-reporting)
- [Video Recording](#video-recording)
- [Recorded Metrics](#recorded-metrics)
- [Max session Length](#max-session-length)
